###Briefly About Myself: 

My programming career started with learning the Java language. I also took courses from Epam on Java Web Development. After the successful completion and delivery of the project. 

The company has closed the recruitment of students for interviews. I found another company and have 6 months commercial experience in web application development. At the moment, I discovered the bright side of front-end development. 

I like the instant feedback of my work, I see what I'm doing and what needs to be improved. I plan to study at RsSchool to become a strong and in-demand front-end developer, get a job and constantly learning.
